		Hi Prime People! <br/>
		Thank you so much for visiting my HTML Resume Challenge Page. I first started to learn how to code at the beginning of this year and had a short internship with Audiofile Engineering, but I haven't done much since. This has been a great way to brush up on my skills and remind me why I love this stuff.<br/>
		Thanks again!
